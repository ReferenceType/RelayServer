# RelayServer
Relay Server Application for the P2P network system, which is required to use the P2PVideocall application and Starfighter Game(currently).
Its a simple and lightweight console app where you can see statistics on browser.

I use this app with port forwarding on my router and i bound my IP to a dynamic dns which is provided by NoIp.com. 
I also have same system for doing what noip is providing, but i didnt have time to deploy it on cloud.
ddns was the simplest solution.
