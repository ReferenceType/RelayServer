# RelayServer
This is a the relay server component for the P2P network system, which is required the use the P2PVideocall application.
Its a simple console app where you can see stlatistics on browser. It is very lightweight.

I use this app with port forwarding on my router and i bound my IP to a dynamic dns which is provided freely by NoIp.com. 
I also have same system for doing what noip is providing, but i didnt have time to deploy it on cloud.
but ddns was simplest solution. I intend to deploy his app on rasbery Pi.
